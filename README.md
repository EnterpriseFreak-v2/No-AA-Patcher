# No-AA-Patcher

(If you want to see how an No-AA patched twilight princess compares to an unmodified one, please take a look at the preview.png file!)

Removes anti-aliasing from your favourite Wii games!
1) Unpack your game using Wiimms ISO Tools (wit extract <yourwbfs> <yourdirectory>)
2) Drag and drop the main.dol onto the No-AA-Patcher.exe file! (the main.dol is located in yourdirectory\DATA\sys)
3) Replace the original main.dol file with the patched.dol the program has created for you.
4) Repack your game using WIT (wit copy <yourdirectory> <yourwbfs.wbfs>)
5) Copy the wbfs you've just packed into the folder of the game, replacing your original wbfs!
6) ???
7) Enjoy better graphics! 
  
(There's no need to do this for wbfs files that you intend to play using Dolphin, Dolphin does not emulate the anti-aliasing effect)
